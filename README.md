# Student-Information-System-Login-Page
I used all TailwindCSS and Bootstrap techniques that I learned from start to finish and created a student information system similar to a mobile application. 
From the sidebar tabs, students can access their grades, learn about their absence or access all the details a student will need. 
This project will be a fullstack project with the database in the future.
